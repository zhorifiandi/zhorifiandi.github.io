# Simplify Your Code Review Process with Automation Tools!

*As engineering teams grow, code reviews become challenging yet still crucial for quality control. We've all been there ‚Äì nitpicking over minor issues while important stuff gets lost. These reviews often become bottlenecks, slowing us down. But by leveraging smart tools and focusing on what really matters, we can speed up the process and make it more effective. Say goodbye to endless debates about tabs vs. spaces!*

# Common Code Review Challenges

Before diving into solutions, let‚Äôs look at some common challenges in "traditional‚Äù code review processes:

- **Manual Checks Are Tedious:** Reviewers often find themselves bogged down by minor style issues or syntax nits, making it harder to focus on the actual logic.
- **Review Quality Is Inconsistent:** Different reviewers may focus on different aspects, which can lead to inconsistent standards across the codebase.
- **Important Details Get Missed:** Manual reviews may not always catch edge cases, especially if the reviewer is unfamiliar with certain code sections.
- **Focus Gets Diverted:** Time spent on minor issues reduces the focus on essential aspects like performance, architecture, or potential scaling issues.

# Tool-Based Solutions for Streamlining Code Review

> *I don't want to reinvent the wheel‚Äîthe only source of truth you should trust is the official documentation for each tool. I'll provide links and references on how to implement them. ü§û.*
> 

## 1. Linter and Static Code Scanning

Linter ensure code follows a consistent style before it reaches the reviewer, while Static Code Scanning will analyze problems and errors not caught by the compilers. Most of the tools have both functionalities out of the box.

This allows developers to focus on logic instead of nitpicking style issues. It‚Äôs best to not only use it in developer local, but also integrate these tools into your CI pipeline to run code formatting checks automatically when a PR is created. PRs with style violations are flagged, to prevent any ‚Äúbad‚Äù PR unintentionally merged to the trunk/master/main/you name it üòÑ.

### Javascript/Typescript - ESLint

For JavaScript teams, setting up Prettier as a pre-commit hook automatically formats code. This eliminates style discrepancies and maintains consistency across the codebase.

- ESLint - https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/getting-started
- How to install it in your PR using Github Action  https://github.com/marketplace/actions/run-eslint

### Go - Golangci-lint

For Go Teams, I prefer using golangci-lint (https://golangci-lint.run/), which is recommended in the Official Go Wiki (https://go.dev/wiki/CodeTools). It bundles tools like [**Staticcheck**](https://staticcheck.dev/docs/running-staticcheck/cli/) and [`go vet`](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/vet), which are recommended by the Golang authors themselves (refer to [the deprecated official linter golang/lint notes).](https://github.com/golang/lint)

## 2. **Integrate Automated Tests in Pull Requests (PRs)**

Tests help validate functionality and performance. When automated tests run on every PR, they catch bugs before the code gets merged. Tests can consist of Unit Test, Integration Test, or even Performance/Load Test. I won‚Äôt cover on how you should write your test, this is not a tutorial post (*if I have enough energy later, maybe I will write one* üôà¬†*)*. I will only show the tip of the iceberg, which is putting some references on how to setting it up in your CI (Pull Request)

**Github Action**

- Node.js: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/use-cases-and-examples/building-and-testing/building-and-testing-nodejs

## 3. **Add Code Scanning for Security and Code Quality**

Security vulnerabilities and code quality issues can be difficult to spot in a manual review, particularly in a large codebase. Tools like SonarQube or CodeQL perform automated scans for issues that could compromise security or degrade performance.

You can setup these tools directly to your repository, which will scan automatically on each PR. Furthermore, Set rules so that PRs cannot be merged until high-severity issues identified by the scanner are resolved.

## 4. **Implement Architecture Unit Tests**

Checking for architectural consistency can be hard, especially as systems grow. Architecture tests ensure that code changes adhere to the established design and principles, keeping the codebase organized and scalable.

Tool that pioneering this is [ArchUnit](https://www.archunit.org/), which covers Java and .NET/C#. (I haven‚Äôt tried them). However, I have tried other tool which inspired by ArchUnit:

- For Typescript: https://github.com/ts-arch/ts-arch
- For Golang: https://github.com/fdaines/arch-go

**Real-World Example:** A large e-commerce system might use ArchUnit to ensure that certain modules don‚Äôt have direct access to sensitive data handling functions. This ensures the system‚Äôs modularity and maintains separation of concerns.

**Implementation Tips:** 

You can write custom architecture validation tests and integrate them into your CI pipeline. This is especially useful for teams that want to maintain strict boundaries between modules. For instance, your team‚Äôs implementing [clean architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html), and you want to avoid *Controller* layer directly calls DB Layer, you can set up this kind of rules. (Pray for me to write article on this one further)

# Focus on What Matters

Once automated tools handle the more tedious parts, reviewers can focus on areas that really matters:

**Requirements**

Check that the code fulfills the requirements by evaluating associated tests and how well they cover the functionality. This helps ensure that the code meets both the functional and non-functional requirements.

**Performance**

Automated tools can only go so far. Performance review might involve checking for inefficient algorithms, slow database queries, or unnecessary data processing, particularly in parts of the system that impact end-users directly.

**Distributed System Concerns**

When working with microservices or other distributed systems, reviewers need to consider failure scenarios, such as network timeouts or partial outages. A well-designed system should handle these gracefully.

**Scalability**

Make sure the code can handle future demands by evaluating scalability considerations. Code that works well under current conditions might fail as user numbers grow, so reviewers should keep an eye on potential scaling issues.

# Wrapping Up

Efficient code review processes are achievable by combining automated tools with targeted human review (yes, you, developers). By using nit checkers, automated testing, code scanning, and architecture checks, you can ensure that your team spends less time on repetitive tasks and more time focusing on impactful issues.

This approach aligns with CI/CD practices and supports the transition towards scaled trunk-based development. While trunk-based development can be challenging, these automated reviews act as a safety net, allowing teams to embrace more frequent merges with confidence. Let's turn code reviews from a chore into a collaborative celebration of great code!
