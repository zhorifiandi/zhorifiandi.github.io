## Getting Started

Now that you have conceptually grasped GraphQL, let's actually use it in Next.js and see how it differs from the previously used Flux-based state management library. ðŸ™‚

Obviously, it is not necessary to use a library to call a GraphQL API. It is possible to simply call the fetch function alone, but using the library provides various functions and has advantages in various aspects such as development experience, so we will go ahead and install the library right away.

Among them, we will use the most used apollo client.

## Building a development environment

First, build the next environment using create-next-app and install the apollo and graphql packages.

```bash
yarn create next-app [Project Name]
cd [Project Name]
yarn add @apollo/client graphql
```

*   graphql: This is a package that allows js to import data through gql.

*   @apollo/client : It depends on the graphql package and provides several functions to use gql in the client.

Now, if you have installed the desired package and type `yarn dev`, the script specified in package.json is executed, and you can see that next.js is operating normally by node.js.

## Initializing the ApolloClient instance

Let's write code that creates an apollo client instance to use the library.

```javascript
// ./apollo-client.js

import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache } from "@apollo/client";

const client = new ApolloClient({
    uri: "https://countries.trevorblades.com",
    cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});

export default client;
```

Enter the `URL` of the gql server in uri and put an `InMemoryCache` instance in `cache`, which is used when caching data retrieved from the client.

Now, in order to run a query, we need to know what kind of data can be retrieved from the URL we have listed. At this time, `Apollo Explorer` is used.

## Apollo Explorer

If you use [Apollo Explorer](https://studio.apollographql.com/dev?_gl=1*19tsww2*_ga*NzY1NTQ1MTU1LjE2NTU4NTYxNTM.*_ga_0BGG5V2W2K*MTY1NjI5Mjk1My41LjEuMTY1NjI5MzYyOC4w), you can see what kind of data can be retrieved through the corresponding url like the API specification of the Rest API. First of all, if you create an account through the link and enter [https://countries.trevorblades.com](https://countries.trevorblades.com/), the endpoint we entered, the following screen will appear.

![](./Untitled_xx8i525r.png)

You can check the schema here and run queries easily. (Think of it as a tool similar to the REST API's Postman.)

If you go to the Schema page, the data that can be imported is specified. Of these, we will bring and use the `code` `name` `emoji` from Country.

You can run the query below on the `Operations` page to check if it is being received normally.

```graphql
query ExampleQuery {
  countries {
    code
    name
		emoji
  }
}
```

If the data comes out normally as shown in the image below, it is successful.

## Data fetching in Client-Side-Rendering

Data fetching methods in Next.js are largely divided into SSR method through `getServerSideProps`, SSG method through `getStaticProps`, and CSR method. Each method differs only in the loading time, but data fetching through gql is the same, so we use CSR Let's write the logic that takes data into account and considers loading.

First of all, you need to wrap the component in `_app.js` with `ApolloProvider`.

```javascript
import { ApolloProvider } from '@apollo/client'
import client from '../apollo-client'
import '../styles/globals.css'

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <ApolloProvider client={client}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ApolloProvider>
  )
}


export default MyApp
```

Now, let's create a `ClientOnly` component that renders only in the client's environment and a `Countries` component that gets data.

`ClientOnly` component

```javascript
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

export default function ClientOnly({ children, ...delegated }) {
  const [hasMounted, setHasMounted] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    setHasMounted(true);
  }, []);

  if (!hasMounted) {
    return null;
  }

  return <div {...delegated}>{children}</div>;
}
```

`Countries` component

```javascript
import { useQuery, gql } from "@apollo/client"

const QUERY = gql`
  query Countries {
    countries {
      code
      name
      emoji
    }
  }
`

export default function Countries() {
  const { data, loading, error } = useQuery(QUERY)

  if (loading) {
    return <h2><a href="#loading" aria-hidden="true" id="loading"></a>Loading...</h2>
  }

  if (error) {
    console.error(error)
    return null
  }

  const countries = data.countries.slice(0, 4)

  return (
    <div >
      {countries.map((country) => (
        <div key={country.code} >
          <h3><a href="#country-name" aria-hidden="true" id="country-name"></a>{country.name}</h3>
          <p>
            {country.code} - {country.emoji}
          </p>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

If a gql query is passed to a hook called `useQuery`, data is fetched through the query. It returns an object containing data, loading, and error, and manages the state of asynchronous processing.

Put that component in `index.js`.

```javascript
import Head from "next/head"
import styles from "../styles/Home.module.css"
import ClientOnly from "../components/ClientOnly"
import Countries from "../components/Countries"

export default function ClientSide() {
  return (
    <div className={styles.container}>
      <Head>
        <title>Create Next App</title>
        <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
      </Head>

      <main className={styles.main}>
        <ClientOnly>
          <Countries />
        </ClientOnly>
      </main>

      <footer className={styles.footer}>
        <a
          href="https://vercel.com"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >
          Powered by{" "}
          <img src="/vercel.svg" alt="Vercel Logo" className={styles.logo} />
        </a>
      </footer>
    </div>
  )
} 
```

The data should be output normally as shown below.

## concluding

It was good that using the library for gql made it much simpler to implement compared to Redux, which requires writing a lot of code to process data. However, it seems to be abstracted as much as it is convenient, so it would be better to know how it works without understanding the internal logic.
