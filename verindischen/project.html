              <h1>RISK AND CHALLENGES</h1>
              <p class="quotes">
              	“Krakande wagens lopen het langst”
              </p>
              <p class="body-content">Up to this point we have created short films, web series, and documentary. Our team consists of various people with distinct background, we easily complement each other. As each of us have our daily job we are pouring countless hours, efforts, and resources into making this vision a reality.</p>
              <br />
              <p class="body-content">The challenge we seem to face is time constrains. As we need an extensive research to create a responsible narative in presenting an accurate representation of historical and cultural dynamics in which the story took place.</p>
              <br />
              <p class="body-content">Your money will help us work miracles with the film but it won&#39;t be able to alter the space time continuum. Where a fully funded feature film can simply pay for an extra day of editing, we might need to make the money stretch further which usually means patiently waiting for our post-crew to work their magic. So, if things are moving slower than we thought, you&#39;ll be the first to know.</p>
              <br />
              <p class="body-content">You have our word, we&#39;ll communicate clearly because after all, you&#39;re trusting us with your money

and we&#39;re going to do everything we can to make sure it&#39;s spent well.</p>
